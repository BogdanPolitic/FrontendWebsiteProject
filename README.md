# FrontendWebsiteProject

This website is made with Bootstrap framework. It is required to run the website using 'gulp'.
Thus, you should type the following commands, from this current path.


	npm init -y
  
	npm install gulp browser-sync gulp-sass --save-dev
  
	npm install bootstrap jquery popper.js --save
  
	npm install gulp-cli -g
  
	gulp
  

The 'gulp' command will start the index.html, and then the site runs normally.
